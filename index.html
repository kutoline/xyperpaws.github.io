We had two goals in mind: to get a professional opinion on the UX/UI aspect of our page and see if it’s ready to be promoted via contextual ads. The results made us happy: we got a detailed report on the needed improvements and a plant of actions. Later, we came back for the implementation of these changes.</div>
